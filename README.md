This GitHub repository showcases a straightforward implementation of digit classification using PyTorch with the renowned MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images featuring handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The primary objective of this project is to leverage PyTorch to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of accurately classifying these digits.

To use the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Training the model and evaluating its performance can be done with provided scripts. The Jupyter Notebook facilitates a more interactive exploration of the dataset and model results.

After training, the model's accuracy on the test set is prominently displayed in the console, providing a quick assessment of its performance. This metric serves as a reliable indicator of the model's ability to accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Additionally, the accompanying Jupyter Notebook offers a visual journey through the training process, presenting training curves and insights into the model's behavior for a comprehensive understanding.

This MNIST classification project serves as a foundational example for leveraging PyTorch in image classification tasks. The customizable architecture makes it accessible for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field of machine learning and computer vision.
